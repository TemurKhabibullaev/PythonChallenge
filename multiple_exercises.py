# Challenges get harder
# 1) Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
name = input('Your name:\n>>> ')
age = input('Your age:\n>>> ')
years_left = 100 - int(age)
year_estimate = 2019 + years_left
print(f'Hi {name} ! In {year_estimate} you will turn 100 years old!')


# 2) Ask the user for a number.
# Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
# Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
your_number = input("Give me a number and I'll detect whether it's odd or even.\n>>> ")
determination = int(your_number) % 2
if determination == 0:
    print('Even !')
else:
    print("Odd !")


# 3) Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers
# (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest)
# and another number.
# The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list
# and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean.
list_of_numbers = [4, 10, 34, 45, 56, 100, 120, 3000]


def is_it_inside ():
    search_num = input("Give me a number, and I'll say whether it's inside my list.")
    if int(search_num) in list_of_numbers:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)


is_it_inside()


# 4) For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are,
# and be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
# When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them
birthdays = {"Arthur": '10/15/1998', "Albert": '10/21/1999', "Temur": '12/10/1999', "Jared": "10/26/2000"}
persons_birthday = input("Whose birthday you need?")
if persons_birthday == "Arthur":
    print(birthdays["Arthur"])
if persons_birthday == "Albert":
    print(birthdays["Albert"])
if persons_birthday == "Temur":
    print(birthdays["Temur"])
if persons_birthday == "Jared":
